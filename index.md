## Microsoft Azure Certification FAQs - Sandy

1. I'm new to Cloud Computing, who to start ?
- For someone how is new and has no knowledge on Cloud or what is cloud even. There is a beautifully constructed article [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/intro-to-azure-fundamentals/what-is-cloud-computing) from Microsoft Learn which gives you the perfect introduction on what is cloud, why it is needed, and why organizations use it.

2. I'm a college student, which Azure certification to pick
- I'd say you can start with [AZ-900](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/azure-fundamentals/?tab=tab-learning-paths) which is the fundamental certification for Azure cloud

3. Will it help me to land in a job if I'm a Azure certified ?
- It depends on the job description and the level you're applying for. But for sure you'll always have the edge over others in terms of initial screening. After this it's all you're skills that matters. **Azure certification is just an entry ticket**.

4. Will Azure certifications help me to land a job inside Microsoft ?
- Nope, there is no direct way to enter into Microsoft just being a Azure Certified professional.

5. How is the learning curve?
- It could be a bit overwhelming for someone who is new to cloud but once you get the hang of it, it's a cake walk. It just takes considerable amount of time (Approx. 2 weeks) to wrap your mind around this.

6. üìåHow to stand out among all other certification holders?
- This is a pretty difficult question, As I'm trying to help people (I'm trying to create competition for myself, right), so the easiest thing to do is to go with a hands-on first approach. This lets you unlock the true potential of Azure and you'll be far ahead of everyone who is just learning it from docs. **Key is to build something with Azure**.

7. What to do after certification?
- Certification is just a recognition from Microsoft that this individual knows a particular piece of Azure offering or cloud practice. You can apply for new roles, look for better opportunities internally and externally.

8. What are the benefits of being Azure certified?
- You will instantly stand out among other in the initial screening phase for any job role which needs Azure skills. Since it's recognized by all the organizations across the glob you'll shine when you say I'm a Azure Certified Professional in a crowd.

9. Why Azure and not Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) ??
- Tricky one, it depends on the use case that you're trying to solve. Azure has deep integration capabilities when you want to build something for a enterprise which is using the Microsoft 365 subscription. This is a huge benefit when compared to all the other cloud provides.

10. Where to learn?
- [Microsoft Learn docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/?product=popular) is the **single source of truth** for all materials related to Azure and all other Microsoft offerings that are available for public use. **All other materials and courses are a sub set of the docs**.
